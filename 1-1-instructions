We will help Alex to build a house, but if we are to meet his megalomaniac 
appetites, we must first find the largest possible square block building plots.
In the programC language to write the function 

int MaxBlock (int** z, int m, int n) 

which returns the length of the sides of the square of the largest block in the table, which is composed of the ones.
Table occupies m rows and n columns containing only ones and zeros. 

For example the table:

0 1 0 1 0 0 
0 1 1 1 1 0 
0 1 1 1 1 1 
0 0 1 1 1 1 
1 0 0 1 0 1 

the length of the sides of the maximum digit of the block is equal to 3
